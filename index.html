            <strong>PAWS (PAWS Animal Welfare Society)</strong>
            is a non-profit animal shelter in Petaling Jaya that has been in operation since 1987. We receive the
            surrender of unwanted dogs and cats which we will vaccinate, deworm, neuter/spay, and put up for adoption.

            Currently, there are over 250 dogs and 250 cats under the care of the shelter. The shelter and all costs
            involved in running it are entirely funded by the generous donations of the public as well as proceeds from
            charitable events.

            The PAWS team consists of four office staff, a number of part-time veterinarians, one vet assistant, seven
            kennel workers, and one driver. PAWS is a registered Society under the Registry of Societies of Malaysia
            that is led by an elected committee.
